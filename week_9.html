                <h2>Week 9: Design Day!!</h2>

                <p>
                    This week I was able to finish up the poster and present at Design Day!! First, there were a couple of changes we made to the experiment study, which I added on the poster. We utilize two solutions, one AR based and the second one haptic and voice based; both solutions use an eye tracker to track the child’s object of interest. In the AR based solution, we project the ASL translation next to the object that has the child’s visual attention. In the haptic and voice-based solution the parent receives a tactile cue when the child is staring at an object. However, to prompt the ASL video on the tablet the parent must use speech. Now, to see if our system influences the parent’s communicative behaviors, we have to test these two solutions across two conditions: one where the system is attention aware and the other where the system is not attention aware. By attention aware I mean aware of where the infant is looking at, in real-time. In the end this is what the poster ended up looking like:

                   The great thing about bringing everything together into a poster is that it reminds you of the progress you’ve made, which is difficult to see when you’re caught up in small goals. I had a fun time presenting it at Design Day and excited to keep working on it during the summer!
