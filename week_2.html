                    This week we discovered a child behavior video corpus that will aid us in
                     developing the user scenario for our project. The MIT Human Speechome Project 
                     was initiated by Roy, who video tapped and compiled 10 hours of audio and video 
                     recordings of his son’s development from birth to age three. The sample videos 
                     featured on the project’s website will allow us to observe how parent-child 
                     interactions occur in a home environment without the rush to perform actual 
                     observations. With the guidance of these videos, I’ll begin storyboarding and
                      designing potential user scenarios for our assistive technology. 
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    Since a large portion of our design entails head tracking for joint-attention detection, 
                    I looked at several object detection libraries that might aid us in developing the interface.
                    OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) gives us an extensive line of tools to work with.
                    The library has been used in research groups, including well-known tech companies such as
                    Google, Intel and Microsoft. The short excerpt from the OpenCV website below describes the
                    wealth of features it offers:

                    <blockquote cite="https://opencv.org/about.html">
                    “The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a comprehensive 
                    set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms.
                     These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human
                    actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, extract 3D models of objects
                    , produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras, stitch images together to produce a
                    high resolution image of an entire scene, find similar images from an image database,
                    remove red eyes from images taken using flash, follow eye movements, recognize scenery
                    and establish markers to overlay it with augmented reality, etc”
                    </blockquote>

                    Next week we hope to get in contact with the university’s ASL department and 
                    create the intial draft of the storyboard.
