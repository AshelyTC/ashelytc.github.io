                <p>
                        Our research question is can we improve deaf child – hearing parent 
                        interaction and language exposure through enhancing joint-attention for 
                        hearing parents.  To develop user-centric technology that addresses the obstacles 
                        in language learning of deaf children we had to conduct literature review to gain a 
                        holistic view of joint-attention development. In this investigation we learned that 
                        half way through the first-year, infants (both hearing and deaf) visually focus more 
                        on objects than on their parents. Typically, this is where episodes of supported 
                        joint-attention take place. These episodes begin with the infant focused on an object 
                        (toy truck, pink ball etc) and the parent providing linguistic information related to 
                        the infant’s object of interest. This seamless language learning activity occurs if the 
                        parent is sensitive and alert to the infant’s attention. However, how do hearing parents 
                        facilitate these types of cognitive and language learning opportunities in the case where
                        speech can’t be used to provide linguistic content. If we’re able to encourage the 
                        attention supporting strategies used by deaf parents of deaf children through our 
                        assistive technology, we will provide hearing parents an aid in nurturing their deaf 
                        child’s language development without relying on speech. 
                </p>

                <p>
                        The first functionality of our tech solution is to detect the infant’s and parent’s 
                        visual focus. Because head position is an accurate proxy for gaze attention we decided 
                        that having an overhead camera coupled with a mat can be used to track the infant’s head 
                        positions scene by scene. We’ll investigate state-of-the-art head tracking libraries to see 
                        the current tools at our disposal. In addition, we’ll present our research proposal to Ally 
                        and Dr. Hall to obtain constructive feedback to further guide the project progress.
